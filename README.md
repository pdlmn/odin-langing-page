My attempt to clone/recreate the look and layout of this [picture](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) as a reference.

What I learned:
- How to use CSS to replicate certain look.
- And more specifically how to use flexbox to position elements. I learned to love flexbox.
